# Datafun-05-sql Project

This is the repo for Module 5.   This will explore using SQL and Python to create and read data from a sqlite database


# Project Description

Test Project: This project drops all tables in a database.  Then creates tables.  Then inserts records.  the python functions start with db01, db02 ...etc.  This returns query results in the sql_queries_test folder to a file called test_query_results.txt

Final Project:  The python files for this start with "a."  They will  create a database called project.sqlite3.  Then it creates 2 tables "authors" and "books". It reads the csv data and inserts it into the books and authors table.  there are queries in the sql_queries folder and a delete and update query in the sql_features folder.  The query results are written to a file called  query_results.txt

*Notes- in the future I would like to make this a dynamic csv to sqlite database program.
