# Datafun-05-sql Project

This is the repo for Module 5.   This will explore using SQL and Python to create and read data from a sqlite database


# Project Description

Test Project: This project drops all tables in a database.  Then creates tables.  Then inserts records.

Final Project:  this project will  create a database called project.sqlite3.  Then it creates 2 tables "authors" and "books"  

Finally it reads the csv data and inserts it into the books and authors table.

*Notes- in the future I would like to make this a dynamic csv to sqlite database program.  


# How to Run

Test Project is in db01_setup.py.   

Final Project for Module 5 is in create_database.py
